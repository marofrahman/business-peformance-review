# Business Performance Review

#### The objective of this project was to conduct a holistic business assessment by leveraging Prism's database of customer, marketing, product and web data. The goal was to identify problem areas (within these four sectors) and opportunities for improvement across all these parts, and to provide recommendations for enhancing business performance. ####

Within each sector, a deep *analytical* dive was performed to better understand underlying issues focusing on certain areas:

**1) Customer**
* Looking at AOV, UPT and churn rates to determine purchasing patterns as well as general consumer behaviour

**2) Marketing**
* Determining the most effective marketing channels via revenues and opt-in percentages driving traffic and conversions

**3) Product**
* Analysis on the most proftable categories as well as quality control via return rates over time

**4) Web**
* Identifying a how a typical consumer journeys through the website by looking at conversion rates between each stage / funnel
