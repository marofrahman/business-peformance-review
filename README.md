# Business performance review

#### The objective of this project was to conduct a holistic business assessment by leveraging Prism's database of customer, marketing, product and web data. The goal was to identify problem areas (within these four sectors) and opportunities for improvement across all these parts, and to provide recommendations for enhancing business performance. ####

Within each sector, a deep *analytical* dive was performed to better understand underlying issues focusing on certain areas:

**1) Customer**

**2) Marketing**
* Determining the most effective marketing channels via revenues and opt-in percentages driving traffic and conversions

**3) Product**
